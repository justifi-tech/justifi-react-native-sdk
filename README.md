## Justifi-react-Native SDK allows you to easily integrate payment functionality into your mobile application. The SDK provides the following features:

# Prebuilt Payment Component - UI System
Our SDK provides a prebuilt UI system that allows you to easily show a bottom sheet modal with all the necessary data to collect credit/debit card and bank account information from your users. This is a great solution if you want to quickly integrate payment functionality into your app without having to build your own UI.

# Component System to Customize UI
In addition to the prebuilt payment component, our SDK also provides a component system that allows you to customize the payment UI to match your app's look and feel. This means you can create your own payment components and styles to adapt the payment process to your app's branding.

# Payment Methods
It supports multiple payment methods, including credit/debit cards and bank accounts.
Also, SDK supports tokenization and validation of credit/debit cards and bank accounts, making it easy for you to securely collect payment information from your users as well as bank transfers.

# Create a Payment - API Call
Once you've collected payment information from your users, our SDK provides an easy-to-use API for creating payments. This API allows you to securely submit payment information to our payment endpoints and receive a response indicating whether the payment was successful or not.

We hope you find our Payment Integration SDK helpful in adding payment functionality to your mobile app. If you have any questions or feedback, please don't hesitate to reach out to our support team.
