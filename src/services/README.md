# We will put here all related to the service layer, such as all requests to the API, all data requests, and we also will define all the methods to access and fine-tuning all that data with the right format in the UI layer (this latter can be extracted into a folder called controllers, ideally these methods must work separated from the API structure, that is why we can avoid changing all the structure if the API changes).
